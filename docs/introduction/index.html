<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Entity of interest</h2>
<p>TODO</p>

<h2>Purpose, scope, audience</h2>
<p>TODO</p>

<h2>Identifying information</h2>
<p>This architecture description is authored by Danny Nyg√•rd Hansen (dnh@qgg.au.dk) at the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics at Aarhus University.</p>

<h2>Documentation status</h2>
<p>Under development</p>

<h2>Architectural design approach</h2>
<p>
    This architecture description (AD) is informed by the principles outlined in DS/ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 (ISO 42010:2022)(TODO ref) (in particular clause 6), the international standard for architecture descriptions of systems and software. While this AD leverages ISO 42010 as a guiding framework, the authors make no claims that it is compliant with all aspects of the standard.
</p>
<p>
    The viewpoints used in this AD are drawn from the comprehensive set defined by Rozanski and Woods <a href="/livinglab-docs/references/#rozanski-woods">[2]</a>, which is based on the 2011 version of ISO 42010(TODO ref). The viewpoints used in this AD include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Context Viewpoint: Describes the system's external interfaces, dependencies, and interactions with its environment to provide a high-level understanding of its operational context.</li>
    <li>Functional Viewpoint: Focuses on the system's functional structure, detailing the responsibilities of major components and their interactions to fulfill required capabilities.</li>
    <li>Information Viewpoint: Examines the system's key data structures, their relationships, and the flow of information within and between components.</li>
    <li>Concurrency Viewpoint: Addresses the system's runtime behavior, including threading, processes, and mechanisms for coordination and synchronization.</li>
    <li>Development Viewpoint: Highlights the system's construction, including module organization, development tools, and build processes, to support the needs of developers.</li>
    <li>Deployment Viewpoint: Details the mapping of software artifacts to hardware infrastructure, capturing the operational environment and deployment strategies.</li>
    <li>Operational Viewpoint: Focuses on the system's ongoing management, monitoring, and operational processes to ensure stability and performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    No claims are made that the specifications of these viewpoints found in <a href="/livinglab-docs/references/#rozanski-woods">[2]</a> are compliant with either version of ISO 42010.
</p>
<p>
    Many of the architecture view components used in this AD, as well as their specifications, are adapted from <a href="/livinglab-docs/references/#rozanski-woods">[2]</a> and <a href="/livinglab-docs/references/#clements-views-and-beyond">[1]</a>. Note that the former, being based on ISO 42010:2011, uses terminology incompatible with ISO 42010:2022. Note also that the latter is not based on either version of ISO 42010, and its terminology also conflicts with that of the standard.
