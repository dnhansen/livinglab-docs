- Use flexbox to make sticky footer.
- Fix flashing when dark mode, changing pages. (Use Ajax??)
- Drawio files are much simpler than SVGs, at least when the SVGs are exported by drawio. Consider setting up a pipeline to modify these files instead! (Is that even possible if I want to use webfonts?)
- cnc view: "static files" textbox is just barely wide enough. It seems like when rendered by the browser it sometimes spills over into two lines. Make it a bit wider.
- cnc view: Should browser be greyed out to denote it is not strictly speaking part of the application?
- How and where to specify which technologies we use? E.g., in cnc view, which server are we using for the reverse proxy?
- Deployment view: The line saying "artifact" should say "internet".
- Where to put information about the network layout? In the deployment view?
- Decide on which fonts to use for UML diagrams. Right now the module layer view uses a different font than everything else.
- Somehow find out how large the UML diagrams are (what does size even mean for SVGs??) and put this in the HTML to improve rendering.
- Dark mode: Contrast between background and text colour.
- Sometimes the localStorage doesn't update when clicking the button. It seems like this happens when: On either index or views page (anything that is not a particular view page), and this page was accessed when in dark mode. If one of these pages is accessed in light mode, then everything works fine. Refreshing doesn't fix it.
- Decide what to include on every view page.
- Literature references, explanations of notation (UML stereotypes etc.).
