- Drawio files are much simpler than SVGs, at least when the SVGs are exported by drawio. Consider setting up a pipeline to modify these files instead! (Is that even possible if I want to use webfonts?)
- How and where to specify which technologies we use? E.g., in cnc view, which server are we using for the reverse proxy?
- Get SVGs to stop jumping. Have tried specifying height and width on <object> which doesn't work. Have also tried messing with the <svg> width, height and viewPort. Also tried wrapping in <div>.
- Dark mode: Contrast between background and text colour.
- Decide what to include on every view page.
- Literature references, explanations of notation (UML stereotypes etc.).
- CI/CD
- Fix indentation everywhere so it conforms to standards for each language.
- Alt text for UML diagrams.
- Table of contents - page, sidebar, sitemap vs. current page contents.
- Is there a way to get Eleventy to remove all unnecessary whitespace? At least that arising from newlines?
- Clarify component types vs. instances in C&C and allocation views.
- Refactor script in body of base.njk which updates the nav.
- Consider whether the sidebar should be on every page. Maybe documentation should only be one part of the site, maybe also an "about" section, or something like that. Then put links to these in header (along with link to docs), and only show sidebar on docs pages.
- Deployment view: End user machines run browsers which function as execution environments (I think?) in which the application runs. Potentially, multiple browsers (or even the same browser) can run multiple instances of the web app. This is not really reflected in the diagram, but maybe this is okay.
- Mapping between views: Understand better the nature of these mappings. E.g., if a deployment view contains a component that is manifested by some artifact, and there is a C&C view that also contains said component, then which element is the component in the C&C view mapped to in the deployment view? The component, the artifact, or even both or neither?
- List of software used to be visible on the site (Eleventy, draw.io, etc.). Right now it's on the index, do we want to move it?
- Rename script.js to something more descriptive. Maybe also style.css.
- Make more robust solution to the arrow shown on external links.
- Should UML diagrams be in figures (with captions)?
- Splash page, if we have more than the technical documentation.
- Only apply view.css to views.
- Colon after element in catalogue: In html template instead?
- Check if we can use media types/queries to toggle images as well.
- Implement auto theme.
- Check whether style load lags behind page load, and if there is a flicker. If so, maybe split up script that toggles theme so that it selects dark.css right after dark.css has loaded, but before the rest of the page loads. Then after page has loaded, check images.
- Support multiple theme selectors in script.
- Understand the "color-scheme" property of :root.
- "color-scheme: dark" gives SVGs a white background. Fix this.
- New sidebar: Dark mode.
- Consider width of sidebar, the chevrons look a bit detached from the text.

FIXED
- Sometimes the localStorage doesn't update when clicking the button. It seems like this happens when: On either index or views page (anything that is not a particular view page), and this page was accessed when in dark mode. If one of these pages is accessed in light mode, then everything works fine. Refreshing doesn't fix it. -- FIX: Bug in script.js which used querySelector instead of querySelectorAll, yielding null when there are no images, throwing an error.
- Fix flashing when dark mode, changing pages. -- FIX: Seemed to have gone away on its own? If it returns, don't use AJAX, that's too complex.
- New sidebar: Chevron rotates when loading page where it is facing down, fix so that it immediately points down.
- New sidebar: Drop-down should be highlighted when collapsed, and the current page is one in its submenu.
